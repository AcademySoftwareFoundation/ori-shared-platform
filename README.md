Hello and welcome to the Open Review Initiative's shared platform repository.

Here you will find a growing collection of code meant to be leveraged across our existing review applications as part of this project, and with projects and software external to the ASWF.

Currently in this repository:

  The **rpa (Review Plugin API)** is a collection of API modules and widgets for building cross-platform plugins for review/playback systems (like Itview, OpenRV, xStudio etc).

For more information about our initiative itself and its projects please see http://aswf.io/openreviewinitiative
