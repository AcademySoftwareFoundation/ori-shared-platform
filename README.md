Hello and welcome to the Open Review Initiative's shared platform repository.

Here you will find a growing collection of code meant to be leveraged across our existing review applications as part of this project, and with projects and software external to the ASWF.

Currently in this repository:

## RPA (Review Plugin API)

To empower VFX and Animation studios to use their custom built review workflows and tools across any review-playback system (such as OpenRV or xStudio), RPA provides a unified collection of API modules and widgets.

RPA is designed for pipeline developers to build their review workflows and tools once and deploy them seamlessly across any review-playback system that supports the RPA implementation.

RPA is an abstraction layer between the review widgets you create and the review-playback systems you use.
